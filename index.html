                        As a Washington, D.C. native, a career working for the U.S. Government was a natural step for
                        Liz after graduating from University.<br>

                        She spent half a dozen years working for Uncle Sam with three of those serving as a U.S. Diplomat
                        assigned to the U.S. Consulate in Milan, Italy. Upon leaving the Foreign Service, Liz pursued a
                        career in law and spent over twenty years working in Litigation. As an over the top dog-mom to
                        several rescue pups over the years, she took her skills and worked in the non-profit sector
                        advocating on behalf of animal welfare issues and organizations. A passion which she continues
                        still wherever she can.<br>

                        Liz has spent the last couple of years living in SE Asia and traveling the region in search of and
                        certainly finding interesting characters and stories she intends to put to paper. She is currently
                        working on a script about a young English lad in the UK with an unconventional career choice
                        who finds himself involved in a murder.<br>
